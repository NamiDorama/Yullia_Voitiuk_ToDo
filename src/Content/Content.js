      I wish I found some better sounds no one’s ever heard <br/>
      I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words <br/>
      I wish I found some chords in an order that is new <br/>
      I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang <br/>
    </p>

      Wish we could turn back time, to the good old days <br/>
      When our momma sang us to sleep but now we’re stressed out <br/>

      We're stressed out <br/>

    <p>
      Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young <br/>
      How come I’m never able to identify where it’s coming from <br/>
      I’d make a candle out of it if I ever found it <br/>
      Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I’d probably only sell one <br/>
    </p>
    <p>It’d be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose <br/>
      Same clothes homegrown a stone’s throw from a creek we used to roam <br/>
      But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered <br/>
      Out of student loans and tree-house homes we all would take the latter <br/>

      We used to play pretend, give each other different names <br/>
      We would build a rocket ship and then we’d fly it far away <br/>
      Used to dream of outer space but now they’re laughing at our face <br/>
      Saying, "Wake up, you need to make money" <br/>
    </p>
    <p>Yeah</p>
