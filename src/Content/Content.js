        [Verse 1] <br/>
        I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard <br/>
        I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words <br/>
        I wish I found some chords in an order that is new <br/>
        I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sing <br/>
        I was told, when I get older, all my fears would shrink <br/>
        But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think <br/>
      </p>

      <p>
        [Pre-Chorus] <br/>
        My name's Blurryface and I care what you think <br/>
        My name's Blurryface and I care what you think <br/>
      </p>

      <p>
        [Chorus] <br/>
        Wish we could turn back time <br/>
        To the good old days <br/>
        When our momma sang us to sleep but <br/>
        Now we're stressed out <br/>
        Wish we could turn back time <br/>
        To the good old days <br/>
        When our momma sang us to sleep but <br/>
        Now we're stressed out <br/>
        We're stressed out <br/>
      </p>

      <p>
        [Verse 2] <br/>
        Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young <br/>
        How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from? <br/>
        I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it <br/>
        Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one <br/>
        It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose <br/>
        Same clothes, home grown, the stone's throw from a creek we used to roam <br/>
        But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered <br/>
        Out of student loans and tree house homes, we all would take the latter <br/>
      </p>

      <p>
        [Pre-Chorus] <br/>
        My name's Blurryface and I care what you think <br/>
        My name's Blurryface and I care what you think <br/>
      </p>

      <p>
        [Chorus] <br/>
        Wish we could turn back time <br/>
        To the good old days <br/>
        When our momma sang us to sleep but <br/>
        Now we're stressed out <br/>
        Wish we could turn back time <br/>
        To the good old days <br/>
        When our momma sang us to sleep but <br/>
        Now we're stressed out <br/>
      </p>

      <p>
        [Bridge] <br/>
        Used to play pretend, give each other different names <br/>
        We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away <br/>
        Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face <br/>
        Singin', "wake up, you need to make money!", yeah <br/>
        Used to play pretend, give each other different names <br/>
        We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away <br/>
        Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face <br/>
        Singin', "wake up, you need to make money!", yeah <br/>
      </p>

      <p>
        [Chorus] <br/>
        Wish we could turn back time <br/>
        To the good old days <br/>
        When our momma sang us to sleep but <br/>
        Now we're stressed out <br/>
        Wish we could turn back time <br/>
        To the good old days <br/>
        When our momma sang us to sleep but <br/>
        Now we're stressed out <br/>
      </p>

      <p>
        [Outro] <br/>
        We used to play pretend, used to play pretend, bunny <br/>
        We used to play pretend, wake up you need the money <br/>
        Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, bunny <br/>
        We used to play pretend, wake up you need the money <br/>
        Used to play pretend, give each other different names <br/>
        We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away <br/>
        Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face <br/>
        Sayin', "wake up, you need to make money!", yeah <br/>
